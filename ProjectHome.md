The Knuth-Plass line breaking algorithm is both elegant and has remained unparalleled in typographical beauty over 30 years.

This project is an attempt to hoist an existing Python implementation up to a contemporary Python version and then extend it to handle vbox packing in addition to the extant hbox packing.

The base code was obtained from http://www.amk.ca/files/python/tex_wrap-1.01.tar.gz on 2 Jul 2010. Although the author appears to have disclaimed rights in the code, I am attempting to affirmatively verify this.
